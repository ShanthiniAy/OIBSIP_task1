# Iris Flower Classification

This is a machine learning project for classifying Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal characteristics.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and is often used for practicing classification algorithms. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target label specifying the species of the iris.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset file (`iris.csv`) and any additional data files used.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- **`src/`**: Python source code for the machine learning model.
  - **`data_loader.py`**: A script to load and preprocess the dataset.
  - **`model.py`**: Contains the machine learning model definition.
  - **`train.py`**: Script for training the model.
- **`models/`**: Saved trained models.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of project dependencies for easy installation.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd iris-flower-classification
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the dataset and preprocess the data.

4. Train the machine learning model by running:

   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

5. Evaluate the model and make predictions.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset (`data/iris.csv`) contains the following columns:

- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm
- Species (target variable)

## Model

We use a machine learning model (you can specify the model type and parameters in `src/model.py`) to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their features.

## Results

Provide information about the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion

Summarize the project's objectives, key findings, and any future improvements or directions.
